ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Vadim Nave, I am pursuing a double degree in Physics and Electrical Engineering at Ariel University.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the world of programming of software and hardware as well.

My adventure starts at the summer of 2020 when I had the great opportunity to volunteer at the biophysics lab in the university and wrote a small script for automatic data analysis in MATLAB and than decided that Python will be more practical.

Later on, I created a team with 2 friends of mine and managed to win the university hackathon that was promoted by IBM.

Short time ago I bought Arduino board, FPGA board and several courses on Udemy and started to colloborate with different friends on different subjects, I would like you to join my journey here.
On my free time I like hiking, I volunteer a lot in the town of Ariel as a handyman for the elderly population and a Hebrew teacher for newcomers from the former Soviet Union countries.
